# Dice Roll (Simulator) on the Command Line

This is a command line application in which a user can roll up to six dice, showing a visual. This was another tutorial I followed along via RealPython
[(https://realpython.com/python-dice-roll/)] to keep practising.

### How to use
1) Download the one file onto your local computer

2) Create a virtual environment with python and random     (??)

3) Run the dice.py file in your command line
